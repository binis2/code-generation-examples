# code-generation-examples

Example projects for Binis CodeGen Library.

## Using annotation processor  
Annotation processor based code generation example is located in **/annotation** folder. This technique keeps the prototypes inside the project. 

## External generation
Multi-module project example with generating code out of the actual project itself. The example is located in **/external** folder. This technique keeps the prototypes outside the actual project.
Run **BuildAll.bat**. *Note: On first run you will have to run it twice to work.*
